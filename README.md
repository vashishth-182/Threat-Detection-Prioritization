## Overview

This project aims to:

- Train a machine learning model for detecting threats from data (e.g. KDD Cup dataset).  
- Provide a mechanism to generate smaller “mini tests” for rapid evaluation.  
- Prioritize threat detection outputs, so more serious/likely threats are surfaced first.  
- Offer an app interface (via `app.py`) to interact or test the model.

## Repository Structure

| File / Folder      | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `train_model.py`   | Script to train the threat detection model on training data. |
| `app.py`           | Main interface / application to run threat detection and prioritization in real-time or batch mode. |
| `make_mini_test.py`| Utility to build smaller test sets (mini-tests) from larger data. |
| `mini_test.txt`    | A sample mini-test dataset. |
| `KDDTest+.txt`     | Full test dataset (from KDD or similar). |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies required to run the project. |

## Features

- Model training for threat detection  
- Mini test set generation to speed up evaluation  
- Prioritization of detected threats (e.g. ranking, severity)  
- Simple app / script wrapper for usage

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vashishth-182/Threat-Detection-Prioritization.git
   cd Threat-Detection-Prioritization
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Here are some common usage scenarios.

- **Train the model**

  ```bash
  python train_model.py
  ```

- **Generate a mini test**

  ```bash
  python make_mini_test.py
  ```

- **Run via the app**

  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

- **Testing & evaluation**

  Use `mini_test.txt` or `KDDTest+.txt` as inputs to check how well the detection + prioritization works.

---

## Data & Testing

- The test data files (e.g. `KDDTest+.txt`) are expected to follow the format used in the KDD Cup threat detection datasets.  
- The `make_mini_test.py` script enables extracting smaller subsets for quicker evaluation.  

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.)  
- Sufficient compute resources to train the model with full data (may require several minutes/hours depending on dataset size)  

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some ideas for improvements:

- Add documentation of the threat prioritization logic (how threats are scored / ranked)  
- Improve model performance (feature engineering, more data, different algorithms)  
- Add unit tests and continuous integration setup  
- Build a web interface / REST API rather than only a script
